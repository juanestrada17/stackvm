Objective = Create a mini VM that reasds a list of instructions (from file or array) and executes them


Example instructions = 
LOAD A
0x10
ADD A 
B
JUMP 0x200
---

FIRST PART 
1. Determine registers and how many => A, B, C, D.
2. Memory Size = 256 bytes - 4K array 
3. Set up a PC to track execution position 
4. Add a stack pointer.  (CALL/RET)


SECOND PART 
1. Choose instruction formal and supported instructions. 
2. Create an enum or set of opcodes for decoding. 

THIRD PART 
1. create a class to hold:
    - Registers 
    - Memory
    - PC
    - Flags 
    - Running state 
FOURTH PART
1. Load instructions from array or file. 
2. parse and load them into memory

FIFTH PART 
DECODE AND EXECUTE 
1. fetch from memory at pc -> decode opcode -> execute logic -> increment pc
